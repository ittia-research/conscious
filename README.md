Next step to be super human.

Explore interfaces between AI and human.

## Latest Status
Basic structure built:
- Find thoughts from text via basic LLM inference.
- Store all data into PostgreSQL:
  - Thoughts, sources -> PostgreSQL tables (relational database)
  - embedding of thought text -> pgvector (vector database)
  - Relationship between and within thoughts, sources -> Apache AGE (knowledge graph)
- Basic backend API (FastAPI)
- Basic web page to interact with backend API (SvelteKit)

## Get Started
Online demo: https://conscious.ittia.net

## Goals
- Find thoughts (knowledge, ideas) that are not within memory.
- Store new thoughts into AI memory.
- Sync between AI and human memory.
- Memory could belong to a individual, a group, or a organization.
- Memory could be linked together (federation).
- Integrate with existing knowledge bases. For example, Obsidian.

And in doing so, hopefully unlock some secrets about conscious.

## Theory
- Reading in a lot of times are to find some missing puzzles.
- People might learn better with the Zone of Proximal Development.

## Guidelines
- No word salad.
